  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Most of the time, I write backend script. Been doing it in 3-4 years with <span>Node.js</span>, sometimes <span>PHP</span> and <span>Python</span>. Database? <span>MongoDB</span>, <span>MySQL</span>, <span>PostgreSQL</span> you name it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can do frontend too, but prefer not to. I do it with <span>Javascript</span>. Like this page, I wrote it all in pure <span>Vanilla</span>. I am quite familiar with <span>React</span> & <span>React Native</span> and <span>Vue</span>.
  </p>

    Not only crafting a software, I deploy it to server too. I know <span>Heroku</span>, <span>AWS</span>, and <span>GCP</span>. I speak git and linux. My work time is spent 88% on terminal.

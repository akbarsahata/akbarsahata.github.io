  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I have been doing software development professionally since 2016. Most of the time I write with <span>Node.js</span>, sometimes
    <span>Go</span>, <span>PHP</span>, or <span>Python</span>. I have worked with various kind of database systems, implemented   
    different kind of architectures, and deployed on multiple cloud services.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can do both backend and frontend. Like this page, I wrote it all in pure <span>Vanilla JavaScript</span>.
    I am also quite familiar with <span>React</span>, <span>Angular</span>, and <span>Vue</span>. Also kinda interested in Data and IoT too.

    Beside writing codes, I do other stuff related to development too. From writing technical documents to reviewing codes,
    I have experienced all cycles in SDLC. I also work with various teams such as product, data, or IoT team in daily basis.
